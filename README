DATABASE SETUP:

The system expects the mysql database running with default time zone set to UTC

Unix
Setting TZ system variable does the trick on linux. See docker documentation for setting TZ sys var on containers

Windows
Windows machines do not have timezone info imported into mysql database. Those must be added before changing server time zone. 
More info along with zone files can be found at: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/time-zone-support.html
The downloaded file can be easily imported with workbench tool. Make sure you select the "mysql" database to make sure that zone files are imported to the correct location.
When setting up a database on windows system UTC timezone can be set by setting default-time-zone in the options file. 
This can be done directly in mysql workbench if needed. Look for "zone" in the options search box.
